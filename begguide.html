      <p>The first night in Minecraft is the most dangerous. You will need to gather resources and build a shelter before nightfall. Start by punching trees to gather wood and make planks. Use these planks to make a crafting table and then use the crafting table to make a wooden pickaxe. Use the pickaxe to mine stone and make a stone sword and other tools. Once you have enough resources, build a shelter with walls and a roof to protect yourself from monsters that come out at night. You can also light up your shelter with torches or other light sources to keep monsters away.</p>

      <p>When you encounter an enemy in Minecraft, you can attack it by clicking the left mouse button. You can also block attacks by holding down the right mouse button with a shield equipped. The amount of damage you deal depends on the weapon you are using and the type of enemy you are fighting. Different weapons have different attack speeds and damage values. For example, a diamond sword deals more damage than a wooden sword. You can also enchant your weapons with various enchantments to make them more powerful.</p>

<p>There are many structures in Minecraft that you can explore and discover. Here are some of the most important ones:</p>
    <ul class="bullet-points">
      <li>Villages: Villages are populated areas that contain various buildings and structures. They are inhabited by villagers who can trade with you.</li>
      <li>Strongholds: Strongholds are underground structures that contain an end portal. The end portal is used to travel to the End dimension.</li>
      <li>Nether Fortresses: Nether fortresses are structures that can be found in the Nether dimension. They contain various loot and materials.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To get to the end portal, you will need to find a stronghold. Strongholds are located underground and can be difficult to find. You can use an Eye of Ender to locate a stronghold. Once you have found a stronghold, you will need to locate the end portal room. The end portal room contains the end portal. You will need to activate the end portal by placing Eyes of Ender in each of the portal blocks. Once the portal is activated, you can jump into it to travel to the End dimension.</p>

<p>Before we move to the building process, let’s first understand the need for a Minecraft house in the game. A house serves the following functions:</p>
    <ul class="bullet-points">
      <li>A safe house that protects you from hostile mobs.</li>
      <li>A safe house that protects you from hostile mobs.</li>
      <li>An easy to manage space for automatic Minecraft farms and mob trapping.

    <h2>Step 1: Build The Walls</h2>
    <p>Much like a real-world house, you first need to build walls that your Minecraft house stands upon. Other than the main four walls, you can construct as many rooms as you want. But don’t forget to leave openings for doors or windows. You simply need to place the blocks and stack them as high as you want the ceiling of your house to be.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Add Doors & Windows</h2>
    <p>Once you have constructed the walls, you can use wood to make doors and glass panes as windows. Using a single door or a double door is your choice. Hostile mobs can’t open either of them. As for the windows, some players leave them open without any glass. But it is an open invitation to mobs like skeletons that can attack you from a distance.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Expand the House</h2>
    <p>After creating the basic structure, it’s time for you to add more practical elements and areas like rooms, roofs, and more to the house in Minecraft. Many players opt for multiple rooms but going for separate floors adds a certain aesthetic to your house. Just don’t forget to add a ladder or stairs to climb onto that floor. Alternatively, you can use this stage to customize your house with personal design elements and unique shapes.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Light It Up</h2>
    <p>It is true that a house in Minecraft stops hostile mobs from reaching you, but that doesn’t stop these hostile mobs from spawning inside the house. To safeguard your casa against them, you need to add various light sources inside your house. Torches are the most popular option, but you can also go for glowstone, lanterns, and other light sources. Some players even place light sources around and on top of the house for extra protection.</p>

  <h2>Step 5: Furnishing Your House</h2>
  <p>After your house structure is ready, it’s time to furnish it. You can have a variety of items in the Minecraft house you build. However, here are some must-haves:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Crafting table</li>
    <li>Bed to set spawn point</li>
    <li>At least one chest</li>
    <li>A source of food, preferably a basic farm that you can use to plant seeds and grow crops</li>
  </ul>

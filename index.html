            <p>Trying to define Minecraft is difficult. From its early days of simple mining and crafting, so much more
              has been added that at times it can feel like a completely different game. In essence, Minecraft is still
              an action-adventure sandbox title, offering players a limitless world they can explore to their heart’s
              content. It offers an array of different modes, perfect for almost any type of gamer. Are you more of a
              creative person? You’ll likely enjoy the endless playground it has to offer, allowing you to build
              anything you can imagine. Or perhaps you’re looking for more of a challenge. You can try to last in its
              survival mode, as you battle against the creatures of the night.</p>

            <p>Minecraft can be a daunting game. Aside from a nearly endless world to explore, you'll encounter dozens
              of deadly enemies, hundreds of craftable items, and several mechanics that are never properly explained
              through tutorials. If you're having trouble coming to grips with this open-ended game, here are the things
              you should do first in Minecraft if you're looking to survive.</p>
